## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.52] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- `add_nodes()` now accepts a `timeseries` parameter for inline timeseries loading from flat DataFrames — automatically deduplicates rows per ID and attaches time-indexed channels
- Timeseries resolution extended to support `hour` (depth 4) and `minute` (depth 5) granularity
- `parse_date_string` now handles `'yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm'` and ISO `'yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm'` formats
- **Timeseries support**: per-node time-indexed data channels with resolution-aware date-string queries
- `set_timeseries()` with `resolution` ("year", "month", "day"), `units`, and `bin_type` metadata
- `set_time_index()` / `add_ts_channel()` for per-node timeseries construction
- `add_timeseries()` for bulk DataFrame ingestion with FK-based node matching and resolution validation
- `get_timeseries()` / `get_time_index()` for data extraction with date-string range filters
- Cypher `ts_*()` functions with date-string arguments: `ts_sum(f.oil, '2020')`, `ts_avg(f.oil, '2020-2', '2020-6')`, etc.
- Query precision validation: errors when query detail exceeds data resolution (e.g. `'2020-2-15'` on month data)
- Channel units (e.g. "MSm3", "°C") and bin type ("total", "mean", "sample") metadata
- Timeseries data persisted as a separate section in `.kgl` files (backward compatible)
- `agent_describe()` includes timeseries metadata, resolution, units, and function reference
- Cypher `range(start, end [, step])` function — generates integer lists for use with `UNWIND`

## [0.5.51] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- Fluent API: `filter()` now supports `regex` (or `=~`) operator for pattern matching, e.g. `filter({'name': {'regex': '^A.*'}})`
- Fluent API: `filter()` now supports negated operators: `not_contains`, `not_starts_with`, `not_ends_with`, `not_in`, `not_regex`
- Fluent API: `filter_any()` method for OR logic — keeps nodes matching any of the provided condition sets
- Fluent API: `offset(n)` method for pagination — combine with `max_nodes()` for page-based queries
- Fluent API: `has_connection(type, direction)` method — filter nodes by edge existence without changing the selection target
- Fluent API: `count(group_by='prop')` and `statistics('prop', group_by='prop')` — group by arbitrary property instead of parent hierarchy

## [0.5.50] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- Shapely/geopandas integration for spatial methods — `intersects_geometry()` and `wkt_centroid()` now accept shapely geometry objects as input in addition to WKT strings
- `as_shapely=True` parameter on `get_centroid()`, `get_bounds()`, and `wkt_centroid()` to return shapely geometry objects instead of dicts
- `ResultView.to_gdf()` — converts lazy results to a geopandas GeoDataFrame, parsing a WKT column into shapely geometries with optional CRS
- Spatial type system via `column_types` in `add_nodes()` — declare `location.lat`/`location.lon`, `geometry`, `point.<name>.lat`/`.lon`, and `shape.<name>` types for auto-resolution in Cypher and fluent API methods
- `set_spatial()` / `get_spatial()` for retroactive spatial configuration
- Cypher `distance(a, b)` now auto-resolves via spatial config (location preferred, geometry centroid fallback)
- Virtual spatial properties in Cypher: `n.location` → Point, `n.geometry` → WKT, `n.<point_name>` → Point, `n.<shape_name>` → WKT
- Spatial methods (`within_bounds`, `near_point_km`, `get_bounds`, `get_centroid`, etc.) auto-resolve field names from spatial config when not explicitly provided
- Node-aware spatial Cypher functions: `contains(a, b)`, `intersects(a, b)`, `centroid(n)`, `area(n)`, `perimeter(n)` — auto-resolve geometry via spatial config, also accept WKT strings
- Geometry-aware `distance()` — `distance(a.geometry, b.geometry)` returns 0 if touching; `distance(point(...), n.geometry)` returns 0 if inside, closest boundary distance otherwise

### Removed

- Cypher functions `wkt_contains()`, `wkt_intersects()`, `wkt_centroid()` — replaced by node-aware `contains()`, `intersects()`, `centroid()` which also accept raw WKT strings

### Fixed

- Betweenness centrality now uses undirected BFS — previously only traversed outgoing edges, causing nodes bridging communities via incoming edges to get zero scores

### Performance

- `RETURN ... ORDER BY expr LIMIT k` fused into single-pass top-k heap — O(n log k) instead of O(n log n) sort + O(n) full projection. **5.4x speedup** on `distance()` ORDER BY LIMIT queries (1M pairs: 2627ms → 486ms)
- `WHERE contains(a, b)` fast path (`ContainsFilterSpec`) — extracts contains() patterns and evaluates directly from spatial cache, bypassing expression evaluator chain
- Spatial Cypher functions 6-8x faster for contains/intersects via per-node spatial cache + bounding box pre-filter:
  - Per-node cache (`NodeSpatialData`): resolves each node's spatial data once per query, cached for all cross-product rows (N×M → N+M lookups)
  - Bounding box pre-filter: computes `geo::Rect` alongside cached geometry; rejects non-overlapping pairs in O(1) before expensive polygon tests
  - `resolve_spatial()` skips redundant expression evaluation for Variable/PropertyAccess — goes directly to cached node data
- Spatial resolution uses WKT geometry cache for centroid fallback path — previously re-parsed WKT on every row
- `intersects()` and `centroid()` avoid deep-cloning `Arc<Geometry>` — use references directly
- `geometry_contains_geometry()` uses `geo::Contains` trait instead of point-by-point boundary check

## [0.5.49] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- Python type stub (`.pyi`) files now included in code graph — enables graph coverage of stub-only packages, compiled extensions, and authoritative type contracts

### Fixed

- Cypher parser now accepts reserved words (e.g. `optional`, `match`, `type`) as alias names after `AS` — previously failed with "Expected alias name after AS"
- Betweenness centrality `sample_size` now uses stride-based sampling across the full node range — previously sampled only the first k nodes, which could be non-participating node types (Module/Class) yielding all-zero scores

## [0.5.46] - 2026-02-20

### Fixed

- Decorator property stored as JSON array instead of comma-separated string — fixes fragmentation of decorators with comma-containing arguments (e.g. `@functools.wraps(func, assigned=(...))`)
- `is_test`, `is_async`, `is_method` boolean properties now explicitly `false` on non-matching entities instead of `null` — enables `WHERE f.is_test = false` queries
- Dynamic project versions (setuptools-scm etc.) now stored as `"dynamic"` instead of `null` on the Project node
- CALLS edges now scope-aware — calls inside nested functions, lambdas, and closures are no longer attributed to the enclosing function (fixes over-counted fan-out in all 7 language parsers)
- `collect(x)[0..N]`, `count(x) + 1` and other aggregate-wrapping expressions in RETURN now work — previously errored with "Aggregate function cannot be used outside of RETURN/WITH"
- `size(collect(...))` and other non-aggregate functions wrapping aggregates now evaluate correctly — previously silently returned `null` because the expression was misclassified as non-aggregate

## [0.5.43] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- List slicing in Cypher: `expr[start..end]`, `expr[..end]`, `expr[start..]` — works on `collect()` results and list literals, supports negative indices

### Fixed

- `size()` and `length()` functions on lists now return element count instead of JSON string length — e.g. `size(collect(n.name))` returns 5 instead of 29
- Duplicate nodes when test directory overlaps with source root (e.g. `root/tests/` inside `root/`) — test roots already covered by a parent source root are now skipped, with `is_test` flags applied to the existing entities instead
- Duplicate Dependency ID collision when same package appears in multiple optional groups — IDs now include the group name (e.g. `matplotlib::viz`)

## [0.5.42] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- `connection_types` parameter for `louvain` and `label_propagation` procedures — filter edges by type, matching the existing support in centrality algorithms

### Fixed

- `CALL pagerank({connection_types: ['CALLS']})` list literal syntax now works correctly — was silently serialized as JSON string causing zero edge matches and uniform scores
- Document list comprehension patterns as unsupported in Cypher reference

## [0.5.41] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- Cypher string functions: `split(str, delim)`, `replace(str, search, repl)`, `substring(str, start [, len])`, `left(str, n)`, `right(str, n)`, `trim(str)`, `ltrim(str)`, `rtrim(str)`, `reverse(str)`

### Fixed

- Duplicate File nodes when source and test roots overlap in code_tree (e.g. `xarray/` source root containing `xarray/tests/` + separate test root)
- Empty `Module.path` properties for declared submodules in code_tree — now resolved from parsed files or inferred from parent directory
- Boolean properties (`is_test`, `is_abstract`, `is_async`, etc.) stored as string `'True'` instead of actual booleans — improved pandas `object` dtype detection to recognize boolean-only columns

## [0.5.39] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- `read_only(True/False)` method to disable Cypher mutations (CREATE, SET, DELETE, REMOVE, MERGE). When enabled, `agent_describe()` omits mutation documentation, simplifying the agent interface for read-only use cases

## [0.5.38] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- Cypher `CALL procedure({params}) YIELD columns` for graph algorithms: pagerank, betweenness, degree, closeness, louvain, label_propagation, connected_components. YIELD `node` is a node binding enabling `node.title`, `node.type` etc. in downstream WHERE/RETURN/ORDER BY clauses
- Inline pattern predicates in WHERE clauses — `WHERE (a)-[:REL]->(b)` and `WHERE NOT (a)-[:REL]->(b)` now work as shorthand for `EXISTS { ... }`, matching standard Cypher behavior
- `CALL list_procedures() YIELD name, description, yield_columns` — introspection procedure listing all available graph algorithm procedures with their parameters and descriptions

### Changed

- `build()` now includes test directories by default (`include_tests=True`)
- CALL procedure error message now hints at the correct map syntax when keyword arguments are used instead of `{key: value}` maps

### Fixed

- CALLS edge resolution in code_tree now uses tiered scope-aware matching (same owner > same file > same language > global) instead of flat bare-name lookup — eliminates false cross-class and cross-language edges
- Rust parser now detects test files at the File level (`_test.rs`, `test_*`, `tests/`, `benches/` conventions) — previously only function-level `#[test]` attributes were detected, leaving File nodes untagged

## [0.5.36] - 2026-02-18

### Changed

- Split `mod.rs` (6,742 LOC) into 5 thematic `#[pymethods]` files: algorithms, export, indexes, spatial, vector — mod.rs reduced to 4,005 LOC
- Enabled PyO3 `multiple-pymethods` feature for multi-file `#[pymethods]` blocks
- Documented transaction isolation semantics (snapshot isolation, last-writer-wins)

### Fixed

- `[n IN nodes(p) | n.name]` now correctly extracts node properties in list comprehensions over path functions — previously returned serialized JSON fragments instead of property values
- `parse_list_value` is now brace-aware — splits at top-level commas only, preserving JSON objects and nested structures
- `EXISTS { MATCH (pattern) }` syntax now accepted — the optional `MATCH` keyword inside EXISTS braces is silently skipped, matching standard Cypher behavior

## [0.5.35] - 2026-02-18

### Added

- CALLS edges now carry `call_lines` and `call_count` properties — line numbers where each call occurs in the caller function
- Comment annotation extraction (TODO/FIXME/HACK/NOTE/etc.) for all non-Rust parsers (Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, Java, Go, C, C++, C#)
- Test file detection (`is_test`) for all parsers based on language naming conventions
- Generic/type parameter extraction for Go 1.18+ and Python 3.12+ (PEP 695) parsers

## [0.5.34] - 2026-02-18

### Added

- `toc(file_path)` method: get a table of contents for any source file — all code entities sorted by line number with a type summary
- `find()` now accepts `match_type` parameter: `"exact"` (default), `"contains"` (case-insensitive substring), `"starts_with"` (case-insensitive prefix)
- `file_toc` MCP tool in `examples/mcp_server.py` for file-level exploration
- `find_entity` MCP tool now supports `match_type` parameter
- Qualified name format documented in `agent_describe()` output (Rust: `crate::module::Type::method`, Python: `package.module.Class.method`)
- Block doc comment support (`/** */`) in Rust parser — previously only `///` line comments were captured
- `call_trace` MCP tool in `examples/mcp_server.py` for tracing function call chains (outgoing/incoming, configurable depth)
- Call trace Cypher pattern documented in `agent_describe()` output
- CHANGELOG.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and CLAUDE.md for project governance

### Changed

- Doc comments added to all critical Rust structs (`KnowledgeGraph`, `DirGraph`, `CypherExecutor`, `PatternExecutor`, `CypherParser`, and 15+ supporting types)
- Rust parser now captures all `use` declarations, not just `crate::` prefixed imports
- MCP tool descriptions improved with workflow guidance (`graph_overview` says "ALWAYS call this first", `cypher_query` mentions label-optional MATCH, etc.)
- GitHub Release workflow now uses CHANGELOG.md content instead of auto-generated notes

## [0.5.31] - 2025-05-15

### Added

- `find(name, node_type=None)` method: search code entities by name across all types
- `source(name)` method: resolve entity names to file paths and line ranges (supports single string or list)
- `context(name, hops=None)` method: get full neighborhood of a code entity grouped by relationship type
- `find_entity`, `read_source`, `entity_context` MCP tools in `examples/mcp_server.py`
- Label-optional MATCH documented in `agent_describe()` — `MATCH (n {name: 'x'})` searches all node types

### Changed

- Code entity helpers (`find`, `context`) moved from Python (`kglite/code_tree/helpers.py`) to native Rust methods for performance
- `agent_describe()` now conditionally shows code entity methods and notes when code entities are present in the graph

### Removed

- `kglite/code_tree/helpers.py` — replaced by native Rust methods on `KnowledgeGraph`

## [0.5.28] - 2025-05-10

### Added

- Manifest-based building: `build(".")` auto-detects `pyproject.toml` / `Cargo.toml` and reads project metadata (name, version, dependencies)
- `Project` and `Dependency` node types with `DEPENDS_ON` and `HAS_SOURCE` edges
- `USES_TYPE` edges: Function → type references in signatures
- `EXPOSES` edges: FFI boundary tracking (PyO3 modules → exposed items)

### Fixed

- Various code tree parser fixes for Rust trait implementations and method resolution

## [0.5.22] - 2025-04-28

### Added

- `kglite.code_tree` module: parse multi-language codebases into knowledge graphs using tree-sitter
- Supported languages: Rust, Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, Go, Java, C++, C#
- Node types: File, Module, Function, Struct, Class, Enum, Trait, Protocol, Interface, Constant
- Edge types: DEFINES, CALLS, HAS_METHOD, HAS_SUBMODULE, IMPLEMENTS, EXTENDS, IMPORTS
- Embedding export support
