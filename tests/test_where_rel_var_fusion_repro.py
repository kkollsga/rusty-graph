"""Repro: WHERE-on-rel-var drops cohort fast path on Wikidata-style cohorts.

Models the user-reported timeout on Wikidata:

    MATCH (p)-[:P27]->({id: 20})            -- citizens of Norway (Q20)
    WITH p
    MATCH (p)-[r]-(other)                   -- all incident edges
    WHERE NOT (type(r) = 'P50' AND startNode(r) = other)
    RETURN p.title AS name, p.description AS desc,
           count(r) AS connections
    ORDER BY connections DESC LIMIT 10

The semantics are equivalent to:

    total - (incoming P50 edges)

A second variant computes the same answer via the "narrow-then-enrich" form
documented in the cohort fusion fall-back memo.

The test asserts:
1. Both queries return the same answer (correctness).
2. The query with WHERE on the rel-var lands on the fused fast path
   (`FusedMatchWithAggregate`), not the generic interpreter.
