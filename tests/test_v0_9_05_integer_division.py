"""0.9.0 gate item §5 — integer division correctness.

Currently `1967 / 10 → 196.7` (always promoted to Float64). Neo4j /
openCypher: int÷int = int (truncated, → 196). Promote to float only
when either operand is float.

These tests are xfail-strict: when the implementation lands, pytest
flips them to XPASS and the strict marker forces removal of the
`@pytest.mark.xfail` decorator. That is the signal to update the
gate-item status in `dev-documentation/0.9.0-readiness.md` §5.
