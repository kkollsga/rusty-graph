"""Structural parity tests.

Evergreen quality gates that grew out of the 0.8.0 storage refactor:

- **god-file gate** — enumerates `*.rs` under `src/graph/`, asserts each
  is ≤ 2500 lines unless it is on the documented exception list. The
  exception list is maintained with a written rationale per entry and
  a target 0.9.0+ follow-up.
- **unsafe-has-SAFETY gate** — every `unsafe { ... }` block has a
  preceding `// SAFETY:` comment (within the last 5 lines).
- **mod.rs purity gate** — each subdir-`mod.rs` file under
  `src/graph/{algorithms,features,introspection,io,mutation,pyapi,query,storage}/`
  is short and contains no `impl` blocks or long function bodies.
