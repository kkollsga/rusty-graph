"""Differential test harness for the Cypher optimizer pipeline.

Every query in DIFFERENTIAL_QUERIES is run twice: once with the
optimizer pipeline enabled (the default), once with `disable_optimizer
=True` (every pass skipped). We assert both produce identical row sets
after normalization.

This is the regression mechanism for **silent correctness failures**
(passes that drop or duplicate rows). Historical bugs in this class —
0.8.27 LIMIT pushdown returning fewer rows than asked, 0.8.30
startNode(r) returning wrong endpoints — would all have failed the
appropriate row-equality assertion.

It does NOT catch:

- **Gate misses** (a fusion pass bails when it could fuse): both
  paths produce the same result, just slower. Needs plan-shape or perf
  regression testing — covered by follow-ups.
- **Execution semantic bugs** that exist in both fast and slow paths
  (rare but real, e.g. 0.8.30 startNode(r) was actually present in both
  paths). Needs cross-mode parity (cypher vs. fluent vs. naive).

When fixing a future silent-correctness bug, **add the bug's triggering
query to DIFFERENTIAL_QUERIES** so the regression is permanent.

# ── Corpus ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Each entry is `(name, fixture, query, params)`. The corpus aims to
# exercise:
#
# 1. One query per registered optimizer pass (so each pass's trigger
#    shape is in the corpus by design).
# 2. Historical bug shapes from CHANGELOG entries (0.8.27 +).
# 3. Edge cases that have surprised optimizers in the past: LIMIT 0,
#    OPTIONAL with no match, ORDER BY ties, DISTINCT, parameterized,
#    multi-MATCH chains.
#
# The corpus deliberately skips vector_score / text_score and spatial
# fusion — those depend on registered embedders or geometry data and
# don't exist in the shared fixtures. They warrant a separate harness
# that builds purpose-specific fixtures.
