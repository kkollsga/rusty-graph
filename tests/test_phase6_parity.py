"""Phase 6 crunch-point parity tests.

Guards the validation-backend phase of the 0.8.0 storage refactor.
Phase 6 ships `RecordingGraph<G: GraphRead>` — a thin wrapper that
delegates every trait call to the wrapped backend while logging the
method name — and a `GraphBackend::Recording(Box<RecordingGraph<
GraphBackend>>)` variant that lets the enum dispatcher exercise the
wrapper end-to-end. The backend is Rust-only (no Python constructor
reaches it); the cross-mode parity matrix for it lives in
`src/graph/storage/recording.rs::tests`.

The three tests here are gates, not functional coverage:

- **Enum-match audit still holds** — re-runs the Phase 5 whitelist
  check to confirm no new enum-match site leaked into Phase 6's
  `recording.rs` or anywhere else.
- **Symbol smoke** — asserts `pub use recording::RecordingGraph;`
  stays in `src/graph/storage/mod.rs` so downstream consumers see the
  type at the documented path.
- **File-count budget** — the Phase 6 crunch-point gate: the phase
  should touch at most three src files beyond the test file. Computed
  against the last on-disk `Phase 5` commit.
