"""Regression tests for the deferred-property-materialization optimization in
GROUP BY aggregation (return_clause.rs).

Background: queries like `RETURN x.title, count(*)` on Wikidata-scale graphs
were doing O(input rows) random-I/O property reads to build group keys, even
when the result collapsed to dozens of distinct groups. The optimization
hashes by NodeIndex during the per-row pass, then resolves property values
once per resulting group. This file pins both correctness (Cypher semantics
preserved) and perf (no O(rows) regression on the in-memory path).
