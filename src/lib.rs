// build showed libsystem_malloc accounting for ~32% of loader-thread
// CPU time. mimalloc is consistently faster than macOS's default
// allocator on small-object-heavy workloads (Strings, HashMaps, Vecs
// in the parser hot loop). Pure Rust dependency — no system dep, just
// a slightly larger build artifact.
