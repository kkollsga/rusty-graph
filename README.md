## Direct Download and Install
Users can download the .whl file directly from the repository and install it using pip. 
- *Note that the release is only compatible with Python 3.12 on win_amd64.*
- *The library is still in alpha, so the functionality is very limited.*
```sh
pip install https://github.com/kkollsga/rusty_graph/blob/main/wheels/rusty_graph-0.2.13-cp312-cp312-win_amd64.whl?raw=true
# or upgrade an already installed library
pip install --upgrade https://github.com/kkollsga/rusty_graph/blob/main/wheels/rusty_graph-0.2.13-cp312-cp312-win_amd64.whl?raw=true

## Installation

```bash
pip install rusty-graph
```

## Basic Usage

```python
import rusty_graph
import pandas as pd

# Create a new knowledge graph
graph = rusty_graph.KnowledgeGraph()

# Create some data using pandas
users_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'user_id': [1001, 1002, 1003],
    'name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
    'age': [28, 35, 42]
})

# Add nodes to the graph
graph.add_nodes(
    data=users_df,
    node_type='User',
    unique_id_field='user_id', 
    node_title_field='name'
)

# View graph schema
print(graph.get_schema())
```

## Working with Nodes

### Adding Nodes

```python
# Add products to graph
products_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'product_id': [101, 102, 103],
    'title': ['Laptop', 'Phone', 'Tablet'],
    'price': [999.99, 699.99, 349.99],
    'stock': [45, 120, 30]
})

graph.add_nodes(
    data=products_df,
    node_type='Product',
    unique_id_field='product_id',
    node_title_field='title',
    # Optional: specify which columns to include
    columns=['product_id', 'title', 'price', 'stock', 'category'],
    # Optional: how to handle conflicts with existing nodes
    conflict_handling='update'  # Options: 'update', 'replace', 'skip', 'preserve'
)
```

### Retrieving Nodes

```python
# Get all products
products = graph.type_filter('Product')

# Get node information
product_nodes = products.get_nodes()
print(product_nodes)

# Get specific properties
prices = products.get_properties(['price', 'stock'])
print(prices)

# Get only titles
titles = products.get_titles()
print(titles)
```

## Creating Connections

```python
# Purchase data
purchases_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'user_id': [1001, 1001, 1002],
    'product_id': [101, 103, 102],
    'date': ['2023-01-15', '2023-02-10', '2023-01-20'],
    'quantity': [1, 2, 1]
})

# Create connections
graph.add_connections(
    data=purchases_df,
    connection_type='PURCHASED',
    source_type='User',
    source_id_field='user_id',
    target_type='Product',
    target_id_field='product_id',
    # Optional additional fields to include
    columns=['date', 'quantity']
)

# Create connections from currently selected nodes
users = graph.type_filter('User')
products = graph.type_filter('Product')
# This would connect all users to all products with a 'VIEWED' connection
users.selection_to_new_connections(connection_type='VIEWED')
```

## Filtering and Querying

### Basic Filtering

```python
# Filter by exact match
expensive_products = graph.type_filter('Product').filter({'price': 999.99})

# Filter using operators
affordable_products = graph.type_filter('Product').filter({
    'price': {'<': 500.0}
})

# Multiple conditions
popular_affordable = graph.type_filter('Product').filter({
    'price': {'<': 500.0},
    'stock': {'>': 50}
})

# In operator
selected_products = graph.type_filter('Product').filter({
    'product_id': {'in': [101, 103]}
})
```

### Sorting Results

```python
# Sort by a single field (ascending by default)
sorted_products = graph.type_filter('Product').sort('price')

# Sort explicitly by direction
expensive_first = graph.type_filter('Product').sort('price', ascending=False)

# Sort by multiple fields
sorted_complex = graph.type_filter('Product').sort([
    ('stock', False),  # Highest stock first
    ('price', True)    # Then by price, lowest first
])
```

### Limiting Results

```python
# Get at most 5 nodes per group
limited_products = graph.type_filter('Product').max_nodes(5)
```

## Traversing the Graph

```python
# Find products purchased by a specific user
alice = graph.type_filter('User').filter({'name': 'Alice'})
alice_products = alice.traverse(
    connection_type='PURCHASED',
    direction='outgoing'
)

# Access the resulting products
alice_product_data = alice_products.get_nodes()

# Filter the traversal target nodes
expensive_purchases = alice.traverse(
    connection_type='PURCHASED',
    filter_target={'price': {'>=': 500.0}},
    sort_target='price',
    max_nodes=10
)

# Get connection information
connection_data = alice.get_connections(include_node_properties=True)
```

## Statistics and Calculations

### Basic Statistics

```python
# Get statistics for a property
price_stats = graph.type_filter('Product').statistics('price')
print(price_stats)

# Calculate unique values
unique_categories = graph.type_filter('Product').unique_values(
    property='category',
    # Store result in node property
    store_as='category_list',
    max_length=10
)
```

### Custom Calculations

```python
# Simple calculation: tax inclusive price
with_tax = graph.type_filter('Product').calculate(
    expression='price * 1.1',
    store_as='price_with_tax'
)

# Aggregate calculations per group
user_spending = graph.type_filter('User').traverse('PURCHASED').calculate(
    expression='sum(price * quantity)',
    store_as='total_spent'
)

# Count operations
products_per_user = graph.type_filter('User').traverse('PURCHASED').count(
    store_as='product_count',
    group_by_parent=True
)
```

## Saving and Loading

```python
# Save graph to file
graph.save("my_graph.bin")

# Load graph from file
loaded_graph = rusty_graph.load("my_graph.bin")
```

## Performance Tips

1. **Batch Operations**: Add nodes and connections in batches rather than individually.

2. **Specify Columns**: When adding nodes or connections, explicitly specify which columns to include to reduce memory usage.

3. **Use Indexing**: Filter on node type first before applying other filters.

4. **Avoid Overloading**: Keep node property count reasonable; too many properties per node will increase memory usage.

5. **Conflict Handling**: Choose the appropriate conflict handling strategy:
   - Use `'update'` to merge new properties with existing ones
   - Use `'replace'` for a complete overwrite
   - Use `'skip'` to avoid any changes to existing nodes
   - Use `'preserve'` to only add missing properties

6. **Connection Direction**: Specify direction in traversals when possible to improve performance.

7. **Limit Results**: Use `max_nodes()` to limit result size when working with large datasets.
